Economists are busy in listing out many more merits and demerit of this policy. The government is saying that
there are only advantages of demonetization policy
and this will be seen in the long term. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who is a noted economist, former
RBI governor and former Finance Minister of the country, dubs the demonetization move as an 'organized loot and legalized plunder'.

However, if we compare the merits verses demerits, it will be safe to conclude that the former outweighs the latter.

Even though there is suffering and agony among the masses right at the moment but the forecast is that its benefits
will be seen in the long run.

The government is taking all the necessary steps and actions to meet the currency demand and soon the trial and
tribulations of the people will be over with the smooth flow of the new currency.
