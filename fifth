Demonetization of currency means discontinuity of the particular currency from circulation and replacing it with a new currency.
In the current context it is the banning of the 500 and 1000 denomination
currency notes as a legal tender.

The governmentâ€™s stated objective behind the demonetization policy are as follows; first, it is an attempt to make India corruption free.
Second it is done to curb black money, third to control escalating price rise, fourth to stop funds flow to illegal activity, 
fifth to make people accountable for every rupee they possess and pay income tax return. Finally, it is an attempt to make a cashless
society and create a Digital India.

There is a background to the current decision of demonetization of 500 and 1000 rupee notes. The government has taken few steps
in this direction much before its November 8, 2016 announcement.

As a first step the government had urged people to create bank accounts under Jan Dhan Yojana. They were asked to deposit all the
money in their Jan Dhan accounts and do their future transaction through banking methods only.

The second step that the government initiated was a tax declaration of the income and had given October 30, 2016 deadline for this
purpose. Through this method, the government was able to mop up a huge amount of undeclared income.
